        We need a few details to understand the issue better. Please run the following code to easily get all the relevant information (works for Julia >=1.9):
        ```julia
        using Pkg
        begin
          println("OS $(Base.Sys.MACHINE)")    # OS
          println("Julia $VERSION")            # Julia version
          # Koma sub-packages
          for (_, pkg) in filter(((_, pkg),) -> occursin("KomaMRI", pkg.name), Pkg.dependencies())
            println(pkg.name)
          end
        end
        ```
