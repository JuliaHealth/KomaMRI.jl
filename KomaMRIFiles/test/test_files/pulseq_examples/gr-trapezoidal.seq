[SIGNATURE]
# This is the hash of the Pulseq file, calculated right before the [SIGNATURE] section was added
# It can be reproduced/verified with md5sum if the file trimmed to the position right above [SIGNATURE]
# The new line character preceding [SIGNATURE] BELONGS to the signature (and needs to be sripped away for recalculating/verification)
Type md5
