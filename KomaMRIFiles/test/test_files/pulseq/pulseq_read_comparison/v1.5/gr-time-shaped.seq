[SIGNATURE]
# This is the hash of the Pulseq file, calculated right before the [SIGNATURE]
# section was added. It can be reproduced/verified with md5sum if the file
# trimmed to the position right above [SIGNATURE]. The new line character
# preceding [SIGNATURE] BELONGS to the signature (and needs to be sripped away
# for recalculating/verification)
Type md5
