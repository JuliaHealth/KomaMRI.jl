# Koma Sequence Scripts

This folder includes example scripts for creating custom pulse sequences to use with KomaMRI.

Some of these functions could eventually be added to the `PulseDesigner` module, but for now, they live here as external scripts. They rely on the `KomaMRIBase` module, but aren't officially part of it or of `PulseDesigner`.

Feel free to use them as starting points for your own sequences or experiments.
