The scripts in this folder are meant to replicate the results of Koma's paper.

They require to have a working installation of JEMRIS and Koma.

You should be located in the directory "examples/5.koma_paper/comparison_jemris/" to run them.

The main script can run for both simulators:

	./run_all_examples.sh

Only for JEMRIS:

	./run_all_examples.sh jemris

Only for Koma:

	./run_all_examples.sh koma

Or you can specify an environment in case you want to test a dev branch of Koma:

	./run_all_examples.sh koma --project=../../../../
	
You can also select an specific example (a,b,c,d,e,f):

	./run_all_examples.sh koma --project=../../../../ e

Then, the NMRSE can be computed by running the script "calculate_simulation_error.m".
